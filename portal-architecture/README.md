# SharePoint Sites & Portals – Case Study

This section documents the design and implementation of **SharePoint Sites and Portals**
used as organizational entry points for systems, reports, document management, and workflows.

The focus of this case study is on **SharePoint Sites / Portals only**.
(Project Server / PWA is documented separately in another repository.)

---

## Overview

Multiple SharePoint sites were designed and deployed to provide:

- Centralized access to organizational systems
- Structured document archiving
- Reporting and dashboards
- Controlled access based on roles and permissions
- A unified portal experience for end users

These sites served as the operational backbone for daily activities across
different departments and factories.

---

## Key Capabilities

- Custom SharePoint Home Pages
- Structured site navigation and menus
- Document libraries for archiving and reporting
- Custom lists for operational data
- Permission management using SharePoint groups
- Multi-site (sub-site) architecture

---

## Screenshots

The `screenshots/` folder contains images captured from the production environment.
They demonstrate the actual structure, configuration, and usage of the portals.

### Included Screenshots

- **Portal Home Page**  
  Central entry point providing access to organizational systems and modules.

- **Custom Lists (Operational Data)**  
  SharePoint lists used for structured data such as stations, capacities, and reference data.

- **Site Navigation & Menu Structure**  
  Left navigation and site menus configured for ease of access and clarity.

- **Document Archiving**  
  Libraries used for structured storage and archiving of documents.

- **Reports Library**  
  Centralized storage of periodic and management reports.

- **Sites & Sub-sites Overview**  
  Collection of sub-sites representing departments, projects, or functional areas.

- **Permission Management**  
  Role-based access control using SharePoint groups and permission levels.

Screenshots serve as **execution evidence**, especially where design-time
access or historical configurations are no longer available.
