# SharePoint Sites & Portals – Case Study

This section documents the design and implementation of **SharePoint Sites and Portals**
used as organizational entry points for systems, reports, document management, and workflows.

The focus of this case study is on **SharePoint Sites / Portals only**.
(Project Server / PWA is documented separately in another repository.)

## Overview

Multiple SharePoint sites were designed and deployed to provide:

- Centralized access to organizational systems
- Structured document archiving
- Reporting and dashboards
- Controlled access based on roles and permissions
- A unified portal experience for end users

These sites served as the operational backbone for daily activities across
different departments and factories.

## Key Capabilities

- Custom SharePoint Home Pages
- Structured site navigation and menus
- Document libraries for archiving and reporting
- Custom lists for operational data
- Permission management using SharePoint groups
- Multi-site (sub-site) architecture
