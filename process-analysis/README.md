## Process Analysis

Before implementation, business processes were analyzed and documented to identify:

- Actors and roles
- Required inputs and outputs
- Approval chains
- Exception scenarios

Artifacts in this folder include:
- Process requirement documents
- Form definitions
- Workflow input/output analysis

These documents formed the basis for SharePoint list design
and Nintex workflow implementation.
