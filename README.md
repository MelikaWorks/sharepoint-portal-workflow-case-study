Enterprise case study: SharePoint Server, Project Server (PWA) and Nintex workflows

# SharePoint Case Study

This repository presents an enterprise case study based on a real-world implementation using:

- SharePoint Server
- Project Server (PWA)
- Nintex Workflow & Nintex Forms

The project focused on automating organizational processes such as secretariat (mailroom) workflows,
project tracking, approvals, and reporting.

Due to platform upgrades and compatibility issues between SharePoint Server and Nintex,
the project was frozen at the execution phase.  
This repository documents the **architecture, process analysis, and workflow logic**
instead of providing deployable source code.

> ⚠️ Note: No executable workflows or templates are included in this repository due to
> NDA and organizational security considerations.
