# Workflow Artifacts

This folder contains supporting documents used during the analysis and
implementation of the Secretariat and Mailroom workflow.

These artifacts are included for **context and documentation purposes only**
and do not represent executable components of the solution.

## Contents

  Official workflow specification document describing the mailroom process,
  approval stages, and routing logic.

- **FV-010428-rev00.xlsx**

## Notes

The original artifacts are maintained in Persian, as they were created and
used in a production environment within a Persian-speaking organization.

These documents are provided strictly for contextual reference and
documentation and do not contain executable workflow logic or proprietary
implementation details.

Core workflow logic, approval structures, roles, and process flows are fully
documented in English within this repository. Detailed implementation aspects
can be discussed verbally when required.
