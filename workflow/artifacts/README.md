implementation of the Secretariat and Mailroom workflow.

These files are included for **context and documentation purposes only**.

## Contents

## Notes

The original artifacts are maintained in Persian, as they were created and
used in a production environment within a Persian-speaking organization.

These documents are provided for context and documentation purposes only
and do not contain executable workflow logic.

Key process logic, workflow design, roles, and approval flows are fully
documented in English within this repository. Detailed implementation
aspects can be discussed verbally when required.
