# Administrative Secretariat & Workflow Automation

This case study documents the design and implementation of an
administrative secretariat workflow using SharePoint Server and Nintex Workflow.

The solution was deployed across multiple factories and supported
end-to-end document intake, registration, review, approval, and archiving.

Due to platform upgrades and localization limitations, the workflow
was paused at production level. This repository documents the
process design, approval logic, and implementation approach.
