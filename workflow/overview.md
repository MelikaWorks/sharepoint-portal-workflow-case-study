# Workflow Overview

This folder documents the design and implementation of a
Secretariat and Mailroom workflow built using SharePoint Server
and Nintex Workflow.

The workflow was deployed across multiple factories and
integrated with organizational portals to streamline
correspondence handling and approvals.

## Key Capabilities

- Centralized document intake
- Role-based routing and approvals
- Automated notifications
- Status tracking and audit trail
- Integration with SharePoint lists and libraries

## Platform Notes

Due to platform upgrades and localization limitations,
direct access to the Nintex workflow designer is no longer available.

For this reason, the workflow is documented using:
- Step-by-step process descriptions
- Reconstructed logic diagrams
- Screenshots from production usage
