# Secretariat and Correspondence Workflow

This workflow was designed to manage incoming and outgoing correspondence
in a centralized, structured, and auditable manner across the organization.

The solution standardizes document intake, routing, review, approval, and
archiving processes using SharePoint Server and Nintex Workflow.

## Main Process Steps

### 1. Initial Registration
- Registration of incoming or outgoing correspondence by the Secretariat
- Assignment of a unique reference number and registration date
- Classification of correspondence type (internal / external)

### 2. Routing and Assignment
- Forwarding the document to the relevant department or responsible manager
- Definition of processing priority
- Addition of contextual notes when required

### 3. Review and Decision
- Review by designated roles within the workflow
- Ability to approve, reject, or reassign the request
- Mandatory comment logging at each decision point

### 4. Final Approval
- Final confirmation by the authorized approver
- Registration of the final workflow status

### 5. Archiving and Tracking
- Storage of records in SharePoint lists and libraries
- Availability of reporting, tracking, and audit trails
