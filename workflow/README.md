## Workflow Design (Nintex)

Multiple Nintex workflows were implemented, including:

- Mailroom / secretariat request handling
- Multi-level approval routing
- Conditional branching based on request type and confidentiality
- Notifications and archiving

Due to Nintex engine incompatibility after platform upgrade,
workflow designer access is no longer available.

For this reason, workflows are documented using:
- Logical step-by-step descriptions
- Diagrams reconstructed from implementation knowledge
