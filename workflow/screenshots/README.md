# Workflow Screenshots

This folder contains screenshots captured from the actual implementation
of the Secretariat and Mailroom workflow built using SharePoint Server and
Nintex Workflow.

The screenshots are provided to demonstrate real execution evidence of the
workflow, including user interfaces, workflow logic, task handling, and
notifications.

## Screenshot Coverage

The screenshots illustrate the following aspects of the solution:

- SharePoint list and form interfaces used for registering correspondence
  (sender, receiver, units, referral type, and metadata)

- Nintex Workflow Designer views showing:
  - Variable assignment
  - Conditional decision branches
  - Status updates
  - Task creation and approval handling
  - Logging and notification steps

- Workflow Cartable (Task List) views displaying:
  - Active workflow instances
  - Waiting and approval states
  - Initiator and elapsed time information

- Email notifications generated by the workflow, including:
  - Approval request emails
  - Workflow status links
  - Completion notifications

## Notes

These screenshots were captured from a production environment.
Some screenshots may contain real names or identifiers as part of the
original system usage. No executable logic, credentials, or sensitive
operational data are exposed.

The original Nintex workflow definition (XML) is not available due to
platform upgrades. Screenshots are therefore used as visual evidence of
the implemented workflow design and behavior.
